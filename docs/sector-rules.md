# Industry research rules

`shared/sectors.js` owns pure industry grouping, overview and detail models. It
depends only on the shared security codec and indicator calculations; it has no
DOM, HTTP or storage dependency. `src/ui/sectors.js` formats these models and
updates the existing HTML. A future API controller or backtest can call the same
functions without constructing a UI context or supplying formatting callbacks.

- Exclude ETFs identified by either `assetType: "etf"` or the legacy `ETF` sector.
- Accept analyzed snapshots and oldest-first market dates for one selected
  session. Do not mix snapshots and calendars from different selected sessions.
- Daily price change uses the snapshot's daily return. Five/twenty-day returns
  require the exact market session before the selected window; do not substitute
  a neighboring traded bar when a member is missing its baseline.
- Average returns are equally weighted across currently priced members. If any
  such member lacks its return, the entire average is unknown (`null`). Unpriced
  members are excluded from the price average but remain in expected flow counts.
- Net-share totals and estimated monetary totals use the indicator module's
  existing complete-stock-window cohort. Unknown is not zero. Monetary estimates
  use each session's closing price multiplied by that session's net shares.
- Amount sorting keeps unknown industries last in both directions and preserves
  input order for equal amounts. Name sorting uses `zh-Hant`. Ranks count only
  industries with finite monetary totals, in the selected display order.
- TOP1 selects the largest monetary buyer for a positive/zero industry net flow,
  or the largest monetary seller for a negative net flow. Changing display sort
  does not change the leader. Equal candidates retain their original order.
- Detail members always sort by daily net monetary amount descending, then name;
  missing values follow known values. Period values remain in TWD and shares,
  leaving units and localized formatting to the caller.

These are a preservation of existing display rules, not a new investment signal.
Returns still use raw prices; corporate-action adjustment is a separate feature.

`tests/sectors-domain.test.js` compares all periods and sort orders with the
pre-extraction algorithm on multiple demo dates and covers ETFs, missing sessions,
partial cohorts, genuine zeros, leader direction, ranking and input immutability.
