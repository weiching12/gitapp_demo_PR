# Market synchronization

## Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `sync.js` | Run one phase; round initialization, cooldown, failure ceiling, checkpoint recovery |
| `sync/plan.js` | Taipei rounds, pending dates and Friday historical rechecks |
| `sync/acquire.js` | Whole-market acquisition, normalization and coverage gates; validated T86 ingestion |
| `sync/snapshot.js` | Content deduplication and immutable history shard construction |
| `sync/publish.js` | Validate current T86 version and switch the public manifest |
| `sync/cleanup.js` | Retire only superseded generations, preserving the current and candidate generation |
| `sync/common.js` | Fingerprints, temporary-key TTL, shard batch size |
| `sync/coordinator.js` | Single named DO, serialized ticks, duplicate/out-of-order suppression |
| `sync/coordinator-store.js` | Durable progress/head storage, legacy import and publication recovery |

## Coordination

Cron calls `MARKET_SYNC.getByName("stock-insight-market-sync")`. The object serializes
the entire asynchronous phase with a promise queue; external I/O must not permit a
second phase to overlap. A failed promise releases the queue. No network request is
held inside `blockConcurrencyWhile`, which has a 30-second timeout.

Progress is persisted in SQLite-backed DO storage rather than KV. Existing
`twse:v2:sync` and the public manifest are imported on first access only; stale KV
reads cannot subsequently roll the authoritative checkpoint back. The old KV sync
key remains untouched and is no longer a current status source. Public APIs still
read KV snapshots and never access the coordinator.

Successful ticks persist their scheduled timestamp. Equal/older timestamps are
ignored, including after object reconstruction. An unhandled storage error does not
claim completion; a later tick resumes the last durable checkpoint. Per-phase
errors still have the existing 30-minute cooldown and three-failure ceiling.

Publication first stores a durable intent, writes the public KV manifest, records
the authoritative head, then clears the intent. Interrupted publication replays the
same manifest before further work. If progress still says `publish` for an already
published generation, it is completed without republishing or making the previous
generation reference itself. KV propagation still has the existing 120-second wait.

This provides one active scheduled writer, not an exactly-once guarantee for every
external side effect during a process crash. A shard written before its checkpoint
can be rewritten on recovery. T86 retains D1's existing unique-slot and transactional
guards. Operators must not publish KV heads independently while the coordinator is
active: its durable manifest is authoritative. Any future repair/import publication
must enter the coordinator as an explicit operation with validation.

## Deployment and verification

Append-only migration `market-sync-v1` creates `MarketSyncCoordinator`; existing
presence objects, KV keys and D1 data are not removed. `MARKET_SYNC` is required;
Cron fails closed rather than falling back to an uncoordinated writer.

Run `npm test` and `npm run test:sync-runtime`. The runtime test uses isolated
workerd + SQLite DO storage, eight concurrent identical requests and sequential
distinct ticks, without production or TWSE access. Unit/integration coverage includes
restart checkpoints, pending-publication replay, failed-request queue recovery,
cooldown/stop policy, duplicate ticks through a full market pipeline, corrections,
ETF history preservation and current-generation cleanup protection.

KV budget: in the usual one-date changed/unchanged pair, writes fall from about
153 to 137 (133 changed + 4 unchanged) because progress is stored in the DO.
Additional DO storage writes and invocation usage replace these KV progress writes;
historical corrections/backfills/retries increase operation counts.
